HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and structuring web pages.
Purpose of HTML in Web Development
~ Structure: Defines the layout of content (e.g., headings, paragraphs, lists).
~ Links: Enables navigation between pages using hyperlinks.
~ Semantics: Provides meaning to content with semantic tags (e.g., <header>, <footer>).
~ Media: Embeds images, videos, and audio into web pages.
~ Forms: Collects user input through forms.
~ Browser Compatibility: Works across all web browsers.

Ans2.
Semantic elements define the meaning and role of content, improving readability, accessibility, and SEO.
Examples and Significance
i) <header>: Represents the top section of a page or section, often containing titles or navigation.
Example:
<header><h1>Welcome</h1></header>
ii) <article>: Represents self-contained content, like a blog post or article.
Example:
<article><h2>News</h2><p>Latest update...</p></article>
iii) <footer>: Defines the footer section, often for copyright or links.
Example:
<footer>&copy; 2025 My Website</footer>

Block-Level Elements
~ Behavior: Start on a new line and take up the full width of their container by default.
~ Usage: Used to create structural elements like headings, paragraphs, and divisions.
~ Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>, <ul>, <table>

Inline-Level Elements
~ Behavior: Do not start on a new line; they take up only as much width as their content.
~ Usage: Used to style or modify content within block-level elements.
~ Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <img>

Ans4.
The <meta> tag provides metadata (information about the webpage) to browsers and search engines. It helps define how the page is displayed, behaves, and is indexed.
Common Uses of the <meta> Tag-
~ Character Encoding: Specifies the character set for the webpage to ensure proper rendering of text.
~ Viewport Settings: Controls how the page is displayed on different devices, especially mobile.
~ SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Provides information like keywords and descriptions for better search engine ranking.
~ Page Refresh and Redirect: Automatically refreshes or redirects the page after a set time.
~ Author and Copyright Information: Provides details about the webpage author or copyright.

Ans5.
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like hierarchy of nodes, allowing developers to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a webpage dynamically.
Relationship Between DOM and HTML
~ HTML as Input: The DOM is created by the browser when it parses the HTML document.
~ Interactive Control: JavaScript uses the DOM to dynamically manipulate HTML content and CSS styles.
~ Hierarchy: HTML elements become nodes in the DOM, with parent-child relationships reflecting the document's structure.

Ans6.
<div>
~  It is a Block-level element (starts on a new line).
~ It is used to group and organize larger sections of content.
~ Used for layout and structure.
~ It applies styles to block-level sections.

<span>
~  It is a Inline element (stays in line with other content).
~ It is used to wrap small portions of inline text or content.
~ Used for styling specific text or content.
~ Applies styles to inline elements.

Ans7.
The alt (alternative text) attribute provides a textual description of an image for situations where the image cannot be displayed or seen by users. It is included within the <img> tag to describe the content or function of the image.

Importance for Accessibility - 
~ Screen Readers: The alt text allows screen readers to describe images to users with visual impairments.
~ Context: It helps users understand the meaning or purpose of an image in the context of the webpage content.
Importance for SEO - 
~ Search Engine Crawling: Search engines cannot "see" images. The alt attribute provides context about the image, helping search engines index and rank the page properly.
~ Relevance: Including descriptive, relevant alt text can improve search visibility, as search engines use it to understand the content of images.

Ans8.
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and modify their behavior or appearance. They are always specified within the opening tag of an element.
How They Modify Elements:
~ Define Behavior: Attributes control the functionality or interaction of elements (e.g., links, forms).
~ Control Appearance: Some attributes define the visual presentation of elements (e.g., styling, dimensions).
~ Provide Metadata: Attributes store metadata about elements, such as names, IDs, or classes for styling and scripting.

Ans10.
Absolute URL:
Definition: Specifies the complete URL, including the protocol (e.g., http:// or https://), domain, and path. It points to a specific resource on the web.
Usage: Used when linking to a different website or a resource that is hosted elsewhere.
Example:
<a href="https://www.example.com/about">About Us</a>

Relative URL:
Definition: Specifies a URL relative to the current document's location. It doesn't include the domain or protocol but instead refers to a file or resource within the same website or directory.
Usage: Used for links to resources within the same website, making it more flexible and portable.
Example:
<a href="/about">About Us</a>
