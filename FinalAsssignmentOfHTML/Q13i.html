        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm a passionate web developer with a keen interest in creating dynamic and responsive web applications. Over the past few years, I've explored both front-end and back-end technologies, working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more.</p>
        <p>My journey began with curiosity about how websites work, and that has evolved into a deep understanding of full-stack development. I love learning new technologies, and my current focus is mastering the MERN stack. Apart from coding, I enjoy solving complex problems and turning ideas into functional web applications.</p>
        <p>This blog is my way of sharing what I've learned, focusing on web development and web design. I hope you find the content here useful, whether you're just starting out or looking to improve your skills.</p>
