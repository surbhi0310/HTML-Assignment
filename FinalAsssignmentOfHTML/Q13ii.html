        <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites. It includes various aspects such as web design, web programming, database management, and web publishing. Web development can be categorized into front-end and back-end development.</p>
        <p>Front-end development involves creating the layout, design, and interactivity of a website using languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies work together to create the visual elements of the website that users interact with.</p>
        <p>Back-end development, on the other hand, focuses on server-side logic, databases, and APIs. Languages like Python, PHP, and Node.js are often used in back-end development to manage the data and make the website dynamic. Together, front-end and back-end development make up full-stack development, providing a complete web solution.</p>
